For the second assignment, I decided to recreate a poster from the graphic designer Mike Joyce. It was from a multitude in a series of posters that he created, and I chose the one that appealed to me the most. Figuring out which div elements to use was not necessarily the hard part for me, as I managed to get everything onto the poster itself fairly quickly. Even getting the colors and the font right was not terribly difficult. I did struggle when it came down to the positioning of each element though, and that was the part that took me the longest. In the end, I did manage to assemble the majority of it correctly, but the main headline is sadly a bit off.
